Red Hat Enterprise Linux Directories:
/boot Files to start the boot process.

/dev Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.

/etc System-specific configuration files.

/home Home directory, where regular users store their data and configuration files.

/root Home directory for the administrative superuser, root.

/run Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the /var/run and /var/lock directories from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

/tmp A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed, or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The /var/tmp directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.

/usr Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories in the /usr directory include the following commands:
  /usr/bin: User commands
  /usr/sbin: System administration commands
  /usr/local: Locally customized software

/var System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under /var.
