awk	"Aho, Weinberger and Kernigan", Bell Labs, 1970s. Interpreted programming language for text processing.
awk -F	(see above) + Set the field separator.
cat	Display the contents of a file at the command line, is also used to copy and or append text files into a document. Named after its function to con-cat-enate files.
cd	Change the current working directory. Also known as chdir (change directory).
cd /	Change the current directory to root directory.
cd ..	Change the current directory to parent directory.
cd ~	Change the current directory to your home directory.
cp	Make copies of files and directories.
cp -r	Copy directories recursively.
cut	Drop sections of each line of input by bytes, characters, or fields, separated by a delimiter (the tab character by default).
cut -d -f	-d is for delimiter instead of tab character, -f select only those fields (ex.: “cut -d “,“ -f1 multilined_file.txt” - will mean that we select only the first field from each comma-separated line in the file)
du	Estimate (and display) the file space usage - space used under a particular directory or files on a file system.
df	Display the amount of available disk space being used by file systems.
df -h	Use human readable format.
free	Display the total amount of free and used memory (use vm_stat instead on MacOS).
free -m	Display the amount of memory in megabytes.
free -g	Display the amount of memory in gigabytes.
grep	Process text and print any lines which match a regular expression ("global regular expression print")
head	Print the beginning of a text file or piped data. By default, outputs the first 10 lines of its input to the command line.
head -n	Output the first n lines of input data (ex.: “head -5 multilined_file.txt”).
kill	Send a signal to kill a process. The default signal for kill is TERM (which will terminate the process).
less	Is similar to more, but has the extended capability of allowing both forward and backward navigation through the file.
ls	List the contents of a directory.
ls -l	List the contents of a directory + use a long format, displaying Unix file types, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, last-modified date and filename.

rm	Remove files or directories.
rm -rf	Remove directories and their contents recursively.
